# E-Blogger

E Blogger is a blogging application where user can create and earn through their blogs.

In order to earn, you need to monetize each blog by using Google AdMobs.

All you need is a Google AdMob account with a Banner Ad Unit Id. You need to enter your Banner Ad Unit Id on Monetization section of E Blogger App and we will handle the rest.

To get banner Ad Unit Id follow these steps:

1. Go to "https://apps.admob.com" and create AdMob account.
2. Once you create a AdMob account, you will be redirected to Google AdMob console. Open the left panel and click on Apps.
3. Click on "Add Your First App" button. You will be asked, "Have you published your application on Google Play or the App Store?" - Click "No".
4. Give any name to your Application and select platform as "Android". Click "Add" button.
5. You will get your AdMob App Id. Now click on "Create Ad Unit" button.
6. Select "Banner" as a ad format in the next step.
7. Give any name to your Ad Unit. Do not change any advanced settings.
8. Once you give name to your Ad Unit, click on "Create Ad Unit" button.
9. You are done! You will see your Banner Ad Unit Id. Remember Banner Ad Unit Id is the one which contains "/" in between.

Note: If you see "Missing Payment Information" on your Google AdMob homepage then you should add payment info. Google will just ask you for your address in order to receive further communications. If you failed to do this step then you won't receive Ads for your Banner Ad Unit Id.

This E Blogger app is a new concept to earn money where we are allowing each user to monetize their own blogs on our application just like monetizing videos on YouTube.
